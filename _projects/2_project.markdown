I spent a semester at CERN on a program funded by the University of Michigan.
I worked on upgrading the electronics of the semiconductor tracker of the ATLAS detector.

You can watch my final presentation [here](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2114378). I have an internal note published about my work at: ATL-COM-UPGRADE-2016-004.


Some of the sights around CERN:

While at CERN I also volunteered with the TEDxCERN event, and as part of it I got to be a speaker for one-minute:
