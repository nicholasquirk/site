Almeda a rock/rnb group I formed with three of my friends at Georgetown University in which I played bass guitar. We played numerous shows around D.C. and were featured in some articles. We won the Adams Morgan Porchfest 2016 festival. Our music is on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/almedadc), [Bandcamp](https://almeda.bandcamp.com/) (download it for free!), and will soon be on Spotify. Check us out on [Facebook too](https://facebook.com/almedadc).
