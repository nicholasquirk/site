Hi, I'm Nick, a first-year physics Ph.D. candidate at Princeton focusing on experimental research in condensed matter. Currently, I am studying hard for the Princeton preliminary exams which are coming in January. 

I did my undergrad at Georgetown University where I worked with Prof. Paola Barbara on the development of high-sensitivity broadband terahertz detectors using graphene and molybdenum disulfide. I also played electric bass in an award-winning rock/rnb band called Almeda), tutored and mentored underclassmen physics students, and played double bass in the symphony orchestra.

While an undergrad I spent a summer at Caltech working on sub-mm wavelength kinetic inductance detector arrays for astronomy applications, I spent a semester at CERN in Meyrin, CH working on total-ioninzing dose analysis of new electronics for the upgrade of the ATLAS detector for the forthcoming HL-LHC, and most recently I spent a summer working at home in New Hampshire for BAE Systems in their laser technology division.

In my free time I enjoy playing bass, doing Taekwondo, telling/writing jokes, speaking French, skiing, and of course, solving physics problems.
