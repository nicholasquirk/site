I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate in the department of physics at Princeton University. I am interested in experimental condensed matter research and am supervised by N.P. Ong. My current work is broadly associated with novel phenomena in topological insulators. This research will become more focused as the year progresses. As an undergraduate I worked in the lab of Prof. Paola Barbara at Georgetown University, in molybdenum disulfide and graphene terahertz optoelectronics. 

Apart from physics research I also enjoy doing taekwondo, playing the double bass and the electric bass guitar, writing songs, and skiing.

My goal is to contribute to the exciting middle half of the 21st century through scientific achievement, academic inquiry, and compassion.
