I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Physics at Princeton University. I am interested in experimental condensed matter research and am currently working under N.P. Ong. My current work is broadly associated with novel phenomena in topological insulators. This work will become more focused as the year progresses. As an undergraduate I worked in the lab of Prof. Paola Barbara at Georgetown University, studying the applicability of molybdenum disulfide and graphene for terahertz optoelectronics. 

Apart from physics research I also enjoy doing Taekwondo, playing the double bass and the electric bass guitar, writing songs, skiing and being outdoors, and weaving comedy into every possible appropriate aspect of my life. I am from Plaistow, NH and thrived at the public high school there, which has an extraordinary music program.

My goal is to in my lifetime contribute to the exciting middle half of the 21st century through scientific achievement, academic inquiry, and compassion.
